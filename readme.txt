Even and Odd Number Counter Program:

This C++ program was written as part of my learning journey to understand the basics of C++ programming. The program counts the number of even and odd numbers in a set of 10 integers input by the user.

Program Overview:

- Prompts the user to input 10 integers
- Stores the integers in an array
- Iterates through the array, counting the number of even and odd numbers
- Displays the count of even and odd numbers

Features:

- User input for integers
- Array data structure for storing integers
- Looping structures using for loops
- Conditional statements for counting even and odd numbers
- Clear and informative output

How to Run the Program:

1. Copy the provided C++ code into a .cpp file
2. Compile the program using a C++ compiler
3. Run the compiled program:
    - On Linux/macOS: ./even_odd_counter
    - On Windows: even_odd_counter.exe
4. Enter 10 integers when prompted

Learning Objectives:

- Understanding basic user input and output
- Using arrays for data storage
- Implementing looping structures (for loops)
- Working with integer variables and modulus operator
- Basic counting and conditional logic
